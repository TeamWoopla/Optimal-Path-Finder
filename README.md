After watching a lot of videos and reading a lot of articles on Machine Learning, we finally decided it's time to give it a shot. Easiest thing we could think about is a 2D optimal pathfinder, which is, in other words, a computer learning to pass through obsticles and get to a certain point on a plane. We added a nice GUI so it would be easy and fun to mess around with and after a little bit of polishing, we managed to build one of the coolest programs we have ever made in our opinion. We really learned a lot making this project and we hope you have fun messing around with it yourselves. We will definitly make more Machine Learning projects in the near future!
